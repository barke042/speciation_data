# Data

Here, you can find the datasets we used in the course. We cannot upload the large datasets due to size limitations imposed by GitHub. Please do not hesitate to ask us if you would like to practise with a dataset we used in the course that you cannot find here.

The dogs dataset we used for the D statistics tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6byji8pr20yw3aj/dogs.vcf.gz?dl=0).
