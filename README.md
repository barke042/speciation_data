# Data

Here, you can find the datasets for that we used in the course. The large datasets cannot be uploaded to GitHub. Therefore, some of the larger datasets are missing. Please do not hesitate to ask us if you would like to practise with one of the bigger datasets.

The dogs dataset we used for the D statistics tutorial can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6byji8pr20yw3aj/dogs.vcf.gz?dl=0).
